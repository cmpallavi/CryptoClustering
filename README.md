# CryptoClustering

We had to get the summary statistic with PCA and original data for  crypto coins performance over day, week, month.
We used elbow menthodto find the cluster size for KMeans method and did KMeans analysis on boht original and scaled PCA data.

Analysis shows:
The clustering with PCA data is a lot more compact! Both methods seems to have clustered the same tickers together. The two outliers are identified in both models but in the PCA model, it is very apparent visually (ethlend and celcius-degree-token). Fewer features seems to cluster the data together and visually better aligned.
